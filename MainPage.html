      <h2>What is Magic: the Gathering?</h2>
		<p>Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic cards or just Magic) is both a collectible and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. Released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first trading card game and has approximately twenty million players as of 2015, and over twenty billion Magic cards produced in the period from 2008 to 2016 alone.
		Magic can be played by two or more players in various rule formats, which fall into two categories: constructed and limited. Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards. In constructed formats, players create decks from cards they ownâ€”usually 60 cards, with no more than 4 of any given card, except for "basic land" cards. The game is played in person with printed cards, or using a deck of virtual cards through the Internet-based software Magic: The Gathering Online, or on a smartphone or tablet, or through other video games such as Magic: The Gathering Arena. - From Wikipedia
